You have found that not only the data is biased, but also that this bias affects the performance of your classification algorithm. You know that this is a main issue and want to write an article that ProPublica will publish to inform the general public. In the article, you will explain the data bias, the algorithm prediction bias, and, because you are super thorough, you will also show how to debias the predictions of the algorithm.\n",
