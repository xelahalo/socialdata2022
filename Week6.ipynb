    "Phew. Is it week 6 already? \n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we had an intro to machine learning and regression and this week we continue with some more ML but focusing on classification instead. There are lots of courses on machine learning at DTU. And across many research areas, people use ML for all kinds of things. So there's a good chance you're already familiar with what's going to happen today. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we continue introducing fundamentals of ML, decision trees and start with some prediction tasks on crime data. You might ask, why are we doing this? Well, a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It ties nicely with how we started this course: do you remember all we learnt about predictive policing in Week 1? So, today it is our turn to make predictions and see how well we can do with the data we have been exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visualization **AND** machine learning is a powerful combination. A combination that is pretty rare. \n",
    "  - Usually it's the case that people are either good at machine learning or data viz, but not both. \n",
    "  - So what we will be able to do in this class is an unusual combo: We can use ML to understand data and then visualize the outputs of the machine-learning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The plan for today is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In part 1, we go more in depth on fundamentals of machine learning;\n",
    "2. In part 2, we get an introduction to Decision Trees;\n",
    "3. In part 3, we put everything together to predict criminal recidivism."
